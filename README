To use this script first create an empty postgres database, then:

log in to your db:
psql --host <host> --port <port> --user <username> <dbname>

load the sql:
begin;
\i ~/WGE/ddl/1/wge_tables.sql
commit;

Now we need to set up the database:
comment out the envdir line in config.yml (or point it to where you want them to go).
Copy the sample development environment and add your db settings:
mv environment/development.yml.sample environment/development.yaml

Bring up the webapp to make sure everything is working:
perl -I lib ./bin/app.pl --port 3030

Now the webapp can see your db lets load some data. Note: Make sure ensembl is installed and in your PERL5LIB.

We have included all the genes and exons (for mouse & human) from ensembl build 73, so load them:
perl -I lib ./bin/load_genes.pl human_genes_73.yaml

Or if you want to generate the yaml file:
perl ./bin/get_all_genes.pl <species>

To add all the crispr pairs to the db:
perl -I lib ./bin/get_all_genes.pl

If you make any changes to the db you can regenerate the DBIx::Class models with:
perl ./bin/dump_schema.pl
